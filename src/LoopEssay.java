		 * LOOPS
		 * 
		 * While Loop
		 * The while loop runs while a condition is true. The condition is evaluated and the loop will
		 * will continue to run until the condition is no longer true. If the condition is not true or 
		 * is never true, the while loop will not run. This type of loop can be used when you want a loop
		 * to run until a certain condition is true.
		 * 
		 * 
		 * For Loop
		 * The for loop is used to loop through an object or array and execute instructions written inside
		 *  the scope of the loop. The for loop has 3 statements that set up and oversee the function of 
		 *  the loop. The first statement in the loop sets the iterating variable to the 
		 * starting number. This variable is often called i and set to a value of 0. The second statement 
		 * in the for loop is the exit statement or the information that tells the loop how many times to 
		 * iterate through the object. The third statement is the iterator itself. Once the first loop
		 * is executed, the iterator will increase the variable by the number assigned in the iterator 
		 * statement. This is usually written as i++ which increases i by one each time a loop is completed.
		 * 
		 * Do While Loop
		 * The do while loop differs from the while loop in one major way. The while loop will only run if 
		 * its condition is true and stops when another condition is met. The do while loop runs once before
		 * any conditions are evaluated. This is not a common loop and is only used when you need an action
		 * performed at least once before any conditions are met or evaluated. Once the first iteration of 
		 * loop is performed, the condition is evaluated and , like the while loop, it either runs while its
		 * condition is true or doesn't run at all.
